      "Ingredients": "1 egg\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n1 tablespoon sugar\n3 teaspoons baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n3/4 cup milk\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil or melted butter",
      "Directions": "In a medium bowl, beat the egg with a wire whisk until fluffy. Stir in the remaining ingredients just until the flour is moistened (the batter will be slightly lumpy); do not overmix or pancakes will be tough. For thinner pancakes, stir in an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk.\nHeat a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat (375°F). (To test the griddle, sprinkle with a few drops of water. If bubbles jump around, the heat is just right.)

Cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbly on top and dry around edges. Turn and cook the other side until golden brown."
