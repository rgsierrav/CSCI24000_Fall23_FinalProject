Stir in the remaining ingredients just until the flour is moistened (the batter will be slightly lumpy); do not overmix or pancakes will be tough. For thinner pancakes, stir in an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk.\nHeat a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat (375°F). (To test the griddle, sprinkle with a few drops of water. If bubbles jump around, the heat is just right.) Brush with vegetable oil if necessary (or spray with cooking spray before heating).\nFor each pancake, pour slightly less than 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbly on top and dry around edges. Turn and cook the other side until golden brown."
